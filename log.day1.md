Plan Epic: Notes CLI App [Python]

**Today's Progress**:
- Recap the notes project
    - A personal knowledge management projects, heavily inspired by months of using [Dendron](https://www.dendron.so)
    - Built in Python with the click CLI app framework
- Installed `miniconda`
- Created a Conda dependency environment
    - Read about Python environments here - https://kiwidamien.github.io/save-the-environment-with-conda-and-how-to-let-others-run-your-programs.html
    - Created the environment
    - Updated the environment with app dependencies
    - Exported the environment to `environment.yml` 
    - Added docs for recovering the environment and running the app
- Fix a hardcoded path for notes directory which would break if you changed the location of the app
- Added a method to open the note files in `vscode`

**Thoughts**: 
- Learned about how Python environments and finally have an algorithm for creating them and making them sharable.
- Learned about `os` module and how you can use Python to open files in other apps
    - Really it's more like: how to use Python to run any CLI command you might need

**Link to work**: 
- No links for the project yet
    - Need to update the commit history and move it to Github before I can share it

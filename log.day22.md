Goal: Build a terminal app to manage a large collection of text notes [Python]

22/100 - 100 Days Of Code

**Day 22 Log: 01/02/2023**

**Today's Progress**:
- Added tests for all the commands
- Added some interesting tests that call command A before testing command B
- Coverage at 97%, not that it means anything

**Thoughts**:
- I almost feel like I should've started with the commands. They unlocked much more coverage than the generators.

**Next**: 
- Start testing on CI with Github Actions
- Package and deploy this for PyPi

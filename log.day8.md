# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 8: 15/01/2023

Goal: Build a terminal app to manage a large collection of markdown notes [Python]

**Today's Progress**:
- Got around git sync, probably related to 2nd drive mounting on Linux. Moved repo to main drive.
- Adds pytest and a series of tests for the fm.make() method
- Read about how to assert types in Python
- BUG: Disabled Pylance and Python VSCode extension because it was incorrectly flagging a missing method on a package


**Thoughts**: 
- Moved the repo to a main drive to avoid any mounting-related weirdness. 
- Pytest is quite nice, but I might be here a while if I want to test everything with unit tests.
- Need to be more creative about how I test: the tests need to be integration tests or e2e

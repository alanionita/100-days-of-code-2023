# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 4: 11/01/2023

Plan Epic: PKM CLI Tool - new name [Python]

**Today's Progress**:
- Learned about `re` package, useful for finding string delimiters using regex
- Dug deeper into the `click` package 
- Looked into conditional `@click.option` statements but settled on `@click.arguments` in the end
- Added a user stories file with statuses
- Completed 4 user stories by enabling the creation of custom notes

**Thoughts**: 
- A bit more energy today
- Bouncy around various resources, but LearnXinY and ChatGPT are the best

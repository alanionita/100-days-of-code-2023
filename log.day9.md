Goal: Build a terminal app to manage a large collection of text notes [Python]

100 Days Of Code - Log

**Day 9: 16/01/2023**

**Today's Progress**:
- Finalised the tests for the `fm` generator module
- Changed the structure again because my setup was not a correct module setup
- I found out that for a Python module you need the `pyproject.toml`, `setup.cfg`, and the `setup.py` - wild
- Moved the tests from the module to a folder external to the module 
- Updated some files to reference from the module and not from the location

**Thoughts**: 
- The multiple file module setup is iffy at best

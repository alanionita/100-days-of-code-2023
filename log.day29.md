New project!!!

29/100 : Build a Calendar app with SvelteKit and AWS [SvelteKit, AWS]

100 Days Of Code

**Day 29 Log: 13/02/2023**  

**Today's Progress**:
- Planned the new project features, more detail in the repo below
- Quick Figma UI mock-up and design research
- Quick Sveltedkit scaffolding
- Adding some extensive docs for answering 'Why dis?'

**Thoughts**:
- Narrowed in on Amplify after seeing a lot of interesting docs on deployment. Want to test out the benefits of it purely for R&D project, with a view to benchmark costs.
- This whole project in an opportunity to distil everything I know via a fullstack app.
- Researching CalDav seems less scary than I initially imagine - for my use case at least.
- Moving more towards `webby` frameworks and Svelte is my current darling. Love how fast the API feels, almost like it melts away.
- DONT's: CSS frameworks or component libraries. My UI should be simple, and even if I wanted to make it more complex I'm planning to stick to a `AAA WCAG rating`. I'd rather roll my own HTML and CSS instead of fiddling with other peoples ideas of right and wrong.

# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 5: 12/01/2023

Plan Epic: PKM CLI Tool - new name [Python]

**Today's Progress**:
- Decided to make the project into a pip package
- Learned about setuptools build system
- Reorganised the project structure to work as a pip package
- Created a setup.py config file
- Debugged module discovery issues
- Added docs to show how to install using pip
- Introduced a bug where the notes are not creating

**Thoughts**: 
- Can now run the tool from the command like eg `pkm-cli create daily` to create daily notes
- Should add an automatic versioning system

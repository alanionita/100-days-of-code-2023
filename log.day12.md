Goal: Build a terminal app to manage a large collection of text notes [Python]

12/100 - 100 Days Of Code

**Day 12 Log: 19/01/2023**

**Today's Progress**:
- Refactored commands to pass in the new notes_store context. Impact on cmd/read and cmd/create
- Refactored the daily notes generator to do less things

**Thoughts**: 
- Pretty slow one today, dare I say boring
- I'm shying away from tests, STOP IT

**Next**: 
- Fix: notes/other file generation
- Get back to adding tests
- Start testing on CI with Github Actions

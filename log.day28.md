28/100 : Build a terminal app to manage a large collection of text notes [Python]

100 Days Of Code

**Day 28 Log: 12/02/2023**

**Today's Progress**:
- Configured the package for Twine deployment added some scripts for build and upload.
- Signed up and configured TestPypi.
- Renamed package to `paperclip` to be able to avoid TestPyPi catalogue clashes
- Deployed to TestPyPi - https://test.pypi.org/project/paperclip/0.0.1/

**Thoughts**:
- Decided to skip the pipeline speed optimizations. Pipeline takes <1min anyway. Worth starting with this task when returning to this project.
- For this project I don't need to deploy to PyPi, TestPyPi should be sufficient.
- Declaring the end of this development. 
- Starting a new project tomorrow, but I'm probably going to update the plan and change the ordering.

Goal: Build a terminal app to manage a large collection of text notes [Python]

13/100 - 100 Days Of Code

**Day 13 Log: 20/01/2023**

**Today's Progress**:
- Recovered the creation of other notes - not daily
- Updated the function structure of the frontmatter utilities
- Worked on implementing better context changing and sharing features

**Thoughts**: 
- Context currently always resets to the default
- Trying out a few methods have not worked: including a singleton pattern
- Context keeps resetting between commands

**Next**: 
- Fix the setting of stores, making it possible to create a note in a different location
- Get back to adding tests
- Start testing on CI with Github Actions

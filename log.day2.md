# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 2: 09/01/2023

Plan Epic: PKM CLI Tool - new name [Python]

**Today's Progress**:
- Moved the project to Github so that I can share progress
- Add a new utility that logs Frontmatter metadata
- Adds a new Frontmatter package
- Add a new read command that logs the files Frontmatter metadata
    - will be useful later

**Thoughts**: 
- Nightmare figuring out which is the right package to use - need to read more on this

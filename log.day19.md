Goal: Build a terminal app to manage a large collection of text notes [Python]

19/100 - 100 Days Of Code

**Day 19 Log: 29/01/2023**

**Today's Progress**:
- Refactored all the methods and commands that depended on the previous changes the context method signatures
- Adds new test for stores / set_location
- Coverage up to 24%

**Thoughts**: 
- Missed 3days due to general busyness and a stronger than usual need for rest
- Motivation is funny isn't it: after loosing these days I was tempted to pack in this whole challenge
- Then I realised that I would be discarding the 81 days left because of loosing 3days
- But that is how bad perfectionism works, it stops us from seeing the woods from the trees
- I'm still here despite that episode
- Am I looking forward to it? No, but it wouldn't be a challenge if it were easy!
- Aiming to speed up and move to another topic before I run out of motivation again. 

**Next**: 
- Get back to adding tests
- Start testing on CI with Github Actions

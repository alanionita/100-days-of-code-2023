# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 6: 13/01/2023

Plan Epic: PKM CLI Tool - new name [Python]

**Today's Progress**:
- Adds autopep formatting
- Refactored the whole app to improve the structure and the naming standards
- Abstracted methods into utility generators in order to simplify commands
- Move the main notes folder

**Thoughts**: 
- Naming of modules has to be simple yet avoid clashing with module names
- Read more about `.egg-info`
- Read more about `__pycache__`
- Get some feedback on this structure

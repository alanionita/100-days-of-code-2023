# Overview

I dedicated days to each project according to the Fibonacci scale below.

If a project takes longer I will use the scale to bump up the time and adjust the plan.

General goals:
- Learn Python
- Build apps using AWS services
- Learn a new framework - SvelteKit
- Build tools for personal use: notes, calendar, streak tracking

# Overview

I dedicated days to each project according to the Fibonacci scale below.

If a project takes longer I will use the scale to bump up the time and adjust the plan.

General goals:
- Learn Python
- Build apps using AWS services
- Learn a new framework - SvelteKit
- Build tools for personal use: notes, calendar, streak tracking

## Estimation scale

> 1, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34 

Each plan item will have the scale assigned as `{scale value}`

eg. Notes CLI App [Python] {3}

# Idea backlog

I will use these ideas if:
- I get bored with the existing plan
- The current plan moves faster than expected
- The current plan is taking too long and I need a break

Goal: Build a terminal app to manage a large collection of text notes [Python]

100 Days Of Code - Log

**Day 11: 18/01/2023**

**Today's Progress**:
- Adds a way to define the notes' location at initialisation
- Created an annotation for this location to be automatically passed in to commands that need it
- Added a new command for echoing out this notes path
- Enabled the Python extension again and got all the juicy benefits: suggestions, linting, formatting

**Thoughts**: 
- Everything is normalising now!

**Next**: 
- Add this new location context to all commands
- Get back to adding tests
- Start testing on CI with Github Actions
